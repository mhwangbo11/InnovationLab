# Motivation
To be honest, I have no idea why I am writing this essay-ish Rmarkdown documentation. As a kid, I don't think I enjoyed learning HTML, Adobe Photoshop, nor building a web site in an AP summer camp in Korea. I felt I signed up for a wrong geek from kindergarten to the 9th grade whether I was participating in summer coding camps or attending 학원(hakwon meaning private institution/academy in Korean) to get certified in Microsoft Word processing and Excel spreadsheet processor. I could share why I decided to leave the country, my time in Auckland (NZ) or time in Vancouver (BC, Canada) to watch Euro 2004 and play soccer, yet I think it's more appropriate to skip those boring, hectic, and chaotic time to 2013.

Ironically, when I was temporarily relocated to Korea from Seattle (WA, USA) due to mandatory military service as a Korean male, the very first book that I read (of course to kill my time) was a book published by an author from Samsung (or Samsung probably published it as a company-wide manual). The author was talking about SQL, big data, and how professionals in companies are shifting its decision making processes from strategy-based goal settings to data-driven decision making processes. Though I was assigned as a tank driver and an executive assistant to the commander for whatever translation/training needed (that's all I can share), I think I spent more time as a data processor and at least created 52-week worth of training programming on Korean version of MS Word equivalent program: 한컴오피스 [han-comp-office] using couple million combinations of shortcuts and etc.

I seriously had no idea I would come back to Seattle, enroll in a Master's in Education Policy program (by the way, check it out it's pretty dope) back at University of Washington to become a professional in the education sector, or to find anything to do. I got to my first full time job as an evaluation project lead after going through 3 internships in 12-month-term by countless networking attempts, then realized what I created via Tableau captured more interests than any resume, cover letters, or portfolios that I have shared with recruiters - I still have no idea how I learned Tableau, why I was so into it, etc...

It seemed naive, unrealistic, yet becoming the reality that this is my 4th and final year as a PhD student (2020 still going through COVID-19, and hopefully we're not in this situation in the near future) with a graduate certificate in Demographic Methods from another department under my belt. I think I have no idea what future brings and somehow while I was transitioning from my 3rd year to 4th year, it seems more clear that I think I want to figure out how to become (or not) a Chief Information Officer (CIO from here or I meant Chief Data Officer (CDO), which I still need to figure out how to specify these two different roles). Perhaps it's better to blame my wife who introduced me to this transparent data science practice. Ironically, I ended up finishing up that certificate of Demographic Methods whereas my wife who finished Master's in Public Health is now working as a R programmer/Epidemiologist at a state agency which is completely different than her previous role as a cost/benefit analyst at a Japanese automotive company. 

I think for me, I feel very clear about what I like to do. I love managing and working with people who manage projects as a coach and as the bad guy to enforce guidelines with some hints of empathy and flexibility instead of coding or becoming a specialist to hone down on a particular matter - this is also another irony that I am still hanging out within my PhD program, it's crazy that the program chair didn't kick me out yet. Perhaps CIO may not be my pathway, perhaps I have more chance to become a CDO, or Chief Project Officer, which is another highly unlikely pathway that I will take. But who knows, I didn't think that I would turn down an offer letter from athletic leadership master program to enroll in an education policy grad school nor joined the clan of my mom's older brother (my uncle is also a professor in Korea who specializes in linguistics and dialects in SouthEast side of Korea). 

Before I forget, oh yes, I'm writing this to keep a record of my thinking process or should be processes and logic about 1) Summarizing the experiences and references (mostly books) that I read for CIO reference 2) Tracking what I have read so I know what to apply for the current/future projects and 3) motivate myself to write more so I can finish my literature review for dissertation and finish write up part of dissertation by April 2021 for committee review to graduate from the current program by June 2021.

Thanks for reading this random post and hopefully, I can finish writing my dissertaion by the time when I am done writing this R Markdown document and work as a research professor who also serves as a chief information officer. 

# Without Further Due
Ok, I don't think you'll believe this but I've written all this junk that you're reading in a software called [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) on its [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) which knits my text as chunks of codes that publishes on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/) and when I login to my [Github](https://github.com/mhwangbo11/InnovationLab/tree/master/CIO), as I push my [commit](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project), this document is also available on my repository so check it out all these hyperlinks if you're interested in more about how I re-learned to code in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) in the past year or two.

As I am writing this stuff, I am also tracking how much I am wasting my time using [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) and I'll make sure I'll write down how much time I have spent each time when I am writing.

# Launching Innovation Lab
When I first joined my current organization as an evaluation project lead, I thought it would be no brainer to ask questions like...

# Estimating Project Timeline
Patrick Gleeson's recommendation from *Working with Coders: A guide to Software Development for the Perplexed Non-Techie (2017, p.38)* suggests estimating a task should be considered as multiple graphs not points and here's how I interpret it:

1) If a project is in its normal distribution curve:
* If a developer says 5 days to develop an unknown chunk, codes, etc., this usually means it will take 5 days to complete.
* Also at the same time it may take a week (7 days) to accomplish a task.
* It will not be a surprising event if it takes up to 10 days to complete.
* Well at least, you can be confident it will not take 25 days to complete such task.

2) If a project is considered in its abnormal form... which could happen:
* 4 days probably is all it takes to bulid the unknown codes.
* Well if the event is on an outlier phase, then it may take 3 days to complete such task.
* Bottom line, there's no way it will take 1 day to complete the unknown.

When I was reading this page, I recalled two previous events:

* Abel Wang from Microsoft mentioned during a university-wide Agile Community of Practice that @ MS, all projects are considered to be on 3-week term.

* Cass Tang from UW TechConnect also mentioned when Cass projects how much time it will take a developer to create a set of codes, Cass multiplies 3 to reported time so that there will be some room for commit and improvement, if possible.
