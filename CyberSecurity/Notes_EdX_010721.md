# Intro

Instructor: [David Aucsmith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aucsmith/)

> "The use of computers has grown exponentially... the ability to manage from and secured them and the skills required has not grown at nearly that rate."

# Summary

* Overview of history of internet
* Basic knowledge
* Risk, data analytics, threat intelligence, and the hunt

# Module 1: Evolution of Cybersecurity

## Inherent Internet Principles

* Best effort
* Difficult to track all the data/codes/nodes/messages
* Ambiguous delivery
* No centralized authentication
* Growth/increased inter-connectivity

## Codifying Internet Security

* Evolution: ARPANET (non-commercial only i.e. can't order a whole pizza) -> DNS (i.e. www.google.com) -> Add on features like Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
* [Orange book | DoD Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC, 1985)](https://www.cs.clemson.edu/course/cpsc420/material/Evaluation/TCSEC.pdf): Great concept yet useless due to its lack of practicality
* Two major issues also include: 1) Issue of anonymity and 2) issue of duplicity

> "What is it that I do not know" when a system as designed meets the criteria or not or exceeds the specifications crietria? "How do you know whjen you're done looking?" [for those issues]

## Assumption of Breach

* Shift in our assumptions that the system is broken or will be breached as well as "How do we operate a system given the particular assumption?"
* Again, two things to consider:

### Adversaries

* Systems don't break, they are attacked.
* Even if you write a perfect code, doesn't mean it's going to survive.
* Can you build an indestructible airplane? Think of it as a similar concept

### Complexity

* We're building a complex system that's considered unknown architecture
* Can you project/predict what is going to happen at a battle? You'd consider sending a scout, build a perimeter, build a fence, start communicating, etc. 
* It just can't stand static. 

### Resource: Criteria to Evaluate Computer and Network Security

> From *Computers at Risk: Computing in the Information Age (1991)*

# Module 2: Basic Knowledge Units for Cyber Education

## Cyber professional

* Combination of "Science" & "Art"
* The "Art" piece can be acquired/learned by how systems are attacked, managed, risk management, architect, etc
* It doesn't even have to come from a Tech's perspective

### It's more important to learn and add value by understanding *context*

* Business process: Manage/mitigate risks i.e. data about people -> considered a business decision.
* Being more technical -> Generally better
* Fundamentals you should study are the following:

## Fundamentals

* What's available now? (Tech-wise) including firewalls, spam filters, duo-factors, etc
* Business process i.e. identification/authentication processes
* Procedural weaknesses
* Training issues i.e. What if someone didn't know you should not share a sensitive info via e-mail?
* How hardware works 
* Basics of programming and how tool works
* Basics of software
* Basics of networking i.e. DNS text transmission ->  is it considered normal?

> **The better you know these, the better you'll be as a cybersecurity professional.** 

### How do you experience these? 

* University (CS or Business degree)
* Artifacts of attacks or incidents 
* Used to be only available for certain professionals within a gov't sector
* Now also available among large institutions i.e. MS, Amazon, Apple, Google, FB...

> **Now these "Arts" are important.**
